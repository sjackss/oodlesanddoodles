    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 13 January 2026</p>

    <p>
      This Refund Policy applies to purchases made through the Oodles &amp; Doodles
      application and website (oodlesanddoodles.app). Please read it carefully
      before making a purchase.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Digital products & subscriptions</h2>
    <p>
      Unless required by law, all sales of digital products, in‑app purchases,
      and subscriptions are <strong>non‑refundable</strong> once access has been
      granted or content has been delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you experience technical issues that prevent you from accessing what
      you purchased, contact us within 7 days so we can investigate and assist.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Duplicate or unauthorised charges</h2>
    <p>You may be eligible for a refund if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have been charged more than once for the same item.</li>
      <li>You see a payment that you believe is unauthorised or made in error.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In these cases, please contact us as soon as possible with your order
      details so we can review and, if appropriate, issue a refund or credit.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Subscription cancellation</h2>
    <p>
      You can cancel your subscription at any time. When you cancel, you will
      continue to have access to paid features until the end of your current
      billing period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cancelling a subscription does not automatically trigger a refund for the
      remaining time in the billing cycle unless required by applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>4. How to request a refund</h2>
    <p>To request a refund or query a charge, please contact:</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Email:</strong> support@oodlesanddoodles.app<br>
      <strong>Subject line:</strong> Refund Request – Oodles &amp; Doodles
    </p>
    <p>Include the following information in your request:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your full name and the email address used in the app.</li>
      <li>Date of purchase and transaction ID (if available).</li>
      <li>A short description of the issue and the reason for your request.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Processing time</h2>
    <p>
      Once your request is received, we aim to review it within 5–10 business
      days. If a refund is approved, it will be processed using the original
      payment method. Your bank or payment provider may take additional time to
      post the credit.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Refund Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date. Continued use of
      Oodles &amp; Doodles after changes are posted means you accept the revised
      policy.
    </p>
